This is a web-based 2-player (local) game created for SENG513. 
The game is created using HTML/CSS/JavaScript
The game that I created is Pig (dice game).

Game Title: Sean's Pig Game

Target Platform: Desktop

Game Genre: Strategy

Game Objective: Each player takes turns rolling a single die and the roll results are added to the score, the goal for each player is to reach 100 points before the other player does.

Game Rules: 

          At the start, each player rolls a die, the player with the higher roll gets to go first, if it is a tie they go again
          
          In a single turn, the player repeatedly rolls a die until a 1 is rolled or the player decides to hold
          
          - If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes next player's turn
          
          - If the player rolls another number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues
          
          - If the player decides to hold, their turn is over and their turn total is added to the total score

            This game continues this way until a player reaches 100 total points. Then the game is over.

Game Mechanics: Each turn, the player is given two buttons: keep rolling! or hold!, the player will get to choose one of these two options.
